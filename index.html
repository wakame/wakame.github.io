<p>Welcome to the official bilingual (English/Japanese) community surrounding <a href="http://wakame-vdc.org">Wakame-vdc</a> and <a href="http://openvnet.org">OpenVNet.</a></p>

<p>It's an informal group discussing not only Wakame-vdc or OpenVNet, but all topics which are closely or remotely related. Do you have a question for us? Have you done a cool hack? Did a new technology come out that looks interesting? Do you just like virtualization and want to hang out? This is the place you've been looking for.</p>

<p>Every three months we plan a meet-up with some cool presentations.â€‚After the presentations everyone is invited to take part in a nomikai, the infamous Japanese drinking party (basically having fun and a few beers).</p>

<p>Do you have a topic you want to present? Cool! We encourage members to propose their own presentations and happily give you the opportunity to do just that. While topics closely related to Wakame-vdc or OpenVNet are prefered, any presentation proposal related to virtualization or networking will be considered.</p>

<h3>OpenVNet 0.7 presentation and live demostration</h3>

<p>In Japanese by Andreas Kieckens.</p>

<p>Recently OpenVNet has released version 0.7 which is its first stable release. OpenVNet can be thought of as a network hypervisor. It allows fully virtualized networks using OpenFlow. During this presentation, Andreas will briefly explain the concept of virtual networking. Afterwards he will show a live demo where OpenVNet is used to join two IaaS cloud systems (Wakame-vdc and Amazon EC2) in a single L2 network.</p>

<h3>OpenVNet source code reading</h3>

<p>In Japanese by Andreas Kieckens.</p>
