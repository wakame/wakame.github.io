{% include JB/setup %}

Wakame-vdc is a free open source IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) cloud computing framework, facilitating the provisioning and management of a heterogeneous virtualized infrastructure. Wakame-vdc virtualizes the entire data center; servers, storage, and networking. Wakame-vdc is managed via a native Web Interface, the Wakame-vdc CLI, or the powerful Wakame-vdc API.

The Wakame Users Group (WUG) is our effort to make Wakame-vdc more accessible to anybody who might be interested. We are a small company with limited resources and don't have time to write and maintain a huge and detailed body of documentation. Through WUG, we wish to reach out and organise workshops where people can learn how to deploy and use Wakame-vdc. If you are interested in Wakame-vdc, virtualization in general, or just feel like hanging out with some fellow tech enthusiasts over a beer or two, you are very welcome to attend a meeting of the Wakame Users Group.

<h2>Upcoming and recent events</h2>

<h4>Wakame-vdc introduction and demo</h4>

<p>During this meeting we will provide a VirtualBox image with Centos6.4 and Wakame-vdc installed. Using that image we we will demo Wakame-vdc and give a workshop on how to use it. It is encouraged to bring your own laptop so you can use the image and follow along with the workshop but this is not required.</p>
