{% include JB/setup %}

Wakame-vdc is a free open source IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) cloud computing framework, facilitating the provisioning and management of a heterogeneous virtualized infrastructure. Wakame-vdc virtualizes the entire data center; servers, storage, and networking. Wakame-vdc is managed via a native Web Interface, the Wakame-vdc CLI, or the powerful Wakame-vdc API.

The Wakame Users Group (WUG) is our effort to make Wakame-vdc more accessible to anybody who might be interested. We are a small company with limited resources and don't have time to write and maintain a huge and detailed body of documentation. Through WUG, we wish to reach out and organise workshops where people can learn how to deploy and use Wakame-vdc. If you are interested in Wakame-vdc, virtualization in general, or just feel like hanging out with some fellow tech enthusiasts over a beer or two, you are very welcome to attend a meeting of the Wakame Users Group.

<h2>Upcoming and recent events</h2>

<h4>New features of Wakame-vdc and OpenVNet</h4>

<p>We'll make a presentation about the progress we've made on the Wakame-vdc and OpenVNet projects. We'll talk a bit about which features have been recently added and which ones we're working on right now. As usual there will be USB sticks available containing the Wakame demo image for people who want to give that a go. If you have encountered any problems while trying out Wakame-vdc or OpenVNet, this meeting will be a great place to ask for assistance.</p>
