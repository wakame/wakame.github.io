<p>Welcome to the official bilingual (English/Japanese) community surrounding <a href="http://wakame-vdc.org">Wakame-vdc</a> and <a href="http://openvnet.org">OpenVNet.</a></p>

<p>It's an informal group discussing not only Wakame-vdc or OpenVNet, but all topics which are closely or remotely related. Do you have a question for us? Have you done a cool hack? Did a new technology come out that looks interesting? Do you just like virtualization and want to hang out? This is the place you've been looking for.</p>

<p>Every three months we plan a meet-up with some cool presentations. After the presentations everyone is invited to take part in a nomikai, the infamous Japanese drinking party (basically having fun and a few beers).</p>

<p>Do you have a topic you want to present? Cool! We encourage members to propose their own presentations and happily give you the opportunity to do just that. While topics closely related to Wakame-vdc or OpenVNet are prefered, any presentation proposal related to virtualization or networking will be considered.</p>

<h3>Presentations</h3>

<h4>Wakame-vdc datacenter spec</h4>

<p>In Japanese by Andreas Kieckens</p>

<p>The Wakame-vdc development team is working on a new feature that will allow you to define data centers in "spec files" using YAML format. Andreas will explain the concept and hopefully show a live demo (depending on how far development has advanced by the meeting time)</p>

<h4>Sharing experiences after trying out Wakame-vdc and OpenVNet</h4>

<p>There will be two short presentations in Japanese by people who have tried out Wakame-vdc and OpenVNet and wish to share their experiences.</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Yatsuhiro Kohei-san has set up Wakame-vdc and OpenVNet through trial and error without extensive knowledge of computer networks. During his presentation he will discuss some of the issues he ran into during setup and how those might be solved.</p></li>
  <li><p>The meeting's sponsor BroadBand Tower Inc. will share how they were introduced to Wakame-vdc and OpenVNet, how they vision its ideal usage and how much of that is a reality today.</p></li>
</ul>
