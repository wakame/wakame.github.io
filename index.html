{% include JB/setup %}

<p>Wakame-vdc is a free open source IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) cloud computing framework, facilitating the provisioning and management of a heterogeneous virtualized infrastructure. Wakame-vdc virtualizes the entire data center; servers, storage, and networking. Wakame-vdc is managed via a native Web Interface, the Wakame-vdc CLI, or the powerful Wakame-vdc API.</p>

<p>The Wakame Users Group (WUG) is our effort to make Wakame-vdc more accessible to anybody who might be interested. We are a small company with limited resources and don't have time to write and maintain a huge and detailed body of documentation. Through WUG, we wish to reach out and organise workshops where people can learn how to deploy and use Wakame-vdc. If you are interested in Wakame-vdc, virtualization in general, or just feel like hanging out with some fellow tech enthusiasts over a beer or two, you are very welcome to attend a meeting of the Wakame Users Group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wakame-vdc's security groups using Linux Netfilter (iptables, ebtables)</li>
