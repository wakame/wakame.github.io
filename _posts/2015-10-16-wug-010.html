<h3>Presentations</h3>

<h4>Wakame-vdc datacenter spec</h4>

<p>In Japanese by Andreas Kieckens</p>

<p>The Wakame-vdc development team is working on a new feature that will allow you to define data centers in "spec files" using YAML format. Andreas will explain the concept and hopefully show a live demo (depending on how far development has advanced by the meeting time)</p>

<h4>Sharing experiences after trying out Wakame-vdc and OpenVNet</h4>

<p>There will be two short presentations in Japanese by people who have tried out Wakame-vdc and OpenVNet and wish to share their experiences.</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Yatsuhiro Kohei-san has set up Wakame-vdc and OpenVNet through trial and error without extensive knowledge of computer networks. During his presentation he will discuss some of the issues he ran into during setup and how those might be solved.</p></li>
  <li><p>The meeting's sponsor BroadBand Tower Inc. will share how they were introduced to Wakame-vdc and OpenVNet, how they vision its ideal usage and how much of that is a reality today.</p></li>
</ul>
