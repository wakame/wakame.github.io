<h3>OpenShift Origin and the future of DevOps discussion</h3>

<p>In Japanese by Etsuji Nakai</p>

<p><a href="https://www.openshift.org" target="_blank">OpenShift Origin</a> is a service that offers a DevOps environment based on Docker and Kubernetes. During this presentation Nakai-san will give an outline of its inner workings and explain the architecture from the end user's point of view.</p>

<p>Since there are many techniques for container based DevOps environments, Nakai-san was thinking of having the following discussions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is OpenShift's architecture any good?</li>
  <li>What kind of use cases can you imagine for it?</li>
  <li>What needs to be done for DevOps environments in the future?</li>
</ul>

<p>Nakai-san's will put together his presentation based on <a href="http://enakai00.hatenablog.com/entry/2016/01/03/211029">this post</a> on his blog. (Japanese)</p>
