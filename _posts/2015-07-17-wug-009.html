<h4>OpenVNet 0.7 presentation and live demostration</h4>

<p>In Japanese by Andreas Kieckens.</p>

<p>Recently OpenVNet has released version 0.7 which is its first stable release. OpenVNet can be thought of as a network hypervisor. It allows fully virtualized networks using OpenFlow. During this presentation, Andreas will briefly explain the concept of virtual networking. Afterwards he will show a live demo where OpenVNet is used to join two IaaS cloud systems (Wakame-vdc and Amazon EC2) in a single L2 network.</p>
