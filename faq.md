## Why use Wakame-vdc?

Because it's awesome!

## Why don't you have any documentation?

We are only a small company with limited resources. We have some customers that pay us to work on Wakame-vdc and that's how we pay our bills. This also means that we have to prioritize the features they want and unfortunately, none of them has shown interest in a full scale body of English documentation so far. :( We are slowly adding documents to our wiki on github but it's very limited at this time. If you could help us out by writing some documentation for Wakame-vdc, we would be extremely grateful.

## But how can I try Wakame-vdc without documentation?

That's exactly the problem we are trying to solve with the Wakame Users Group. We organize workshops where we explain how to install and use Wakame-vdc. If you are in Tokyo, we would love to see you attend a session. If you are not in Tokyo, all of the Wakame Users Group meetings are streamed and recordings of them are online on our official UStream account. We suggest you check some of them out. If you have further questions, try the [Google Group](google_group.html) or our [public chatroom](chatroom.html).

## Do you have a yum repository?

Yes we do. You can find instructions on how install Wakame-vdc on Centos 6 through yum [here](https://github.com/axsh/wakame-vdc/tree/master/rpmbuild). Do keep in mind that these are development rpm packages compiled from our git repository. These are rebuilt after every commit and are thus very unstable. Also we realize that they are currently not organized all too well. We are working on a new more intuitive version of these.

# How can I help out?

You could help us in many ways. For starters you could attend a WUG meeting, learn how to use Wakame-vdc and spread the word. We would also be very happy to see you report bugs or contribute code to us. You can do so through github issues or pull requests respectively.
